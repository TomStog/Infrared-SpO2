# Infrared-SpO2
The dataset used for the "A non-contact SpO2 estimation using video magnification and infrared data" [publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10095244) and "A study of machine learning regression techniques for
Non-Contact SpO2 Estimation from infrared motion magnified facial video" [publication](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/14/6/301). The code developed is to fit the data to the reference SpO2 values. The code used for Eulerian Video Magnification was available from [here](http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/evm/#code). The dataset can be viewed and downloaded through this [link](https://mega.nz/folder/eFRSXDSS#DLs4LrSdp1p0Rwv0GOYkOA).
